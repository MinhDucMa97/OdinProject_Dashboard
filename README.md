# OdinProject_Dashboard

This project is a hands-on exploration of modern CSS techniques, including Grid, Flexbox, and advanced styling practices. It also incorporates JavaScript to create a fully functional and interactive website.

I chose to build a food review and travel news dashboard that provides users with a wide range of information related to culinary experiences, cuisines, and foods from various countries.

This website serves as a food travelerâ€™s vlog or an admin dashboard, offering valuable insights for food enthusiasts. I paid careful attention to designing the template, structuring the website, and selecting a color scheme that enhances the user experience.

Thing I learned from this project:
1. Utilizing Grid & Flexbox to create website template
2. Correctly using selector
3. Animation effect for web components
4. Using event listener to produce funtionable website
